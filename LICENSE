Modified WTFPL:
I deem you allowed to reuse my code anywhere and even commercially as long as:
You keep the disclaimers in the code
You keep the links to source I used in the code (I don't want to get in trouble)
You keep the link to this on ShaderToy
You do not modify the terms

You do not have to keep my credits, however I urge you to leave them here in the source.
If you are absolutely not able to follow these terms, that is OK and I allow you I guess.
It would be nice if you did follow them though.
